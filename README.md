# GKDTree - A KDTree Extension for Godot Engine

GKDTree enhances the traditional KDTree structure for seamless integration with the Godot Engine, specifically tailored for use with godot-cpp. Developed as an extension of the KDTree implementations by @walaj and @crvs, GKDTree bridges the functionality of KDTree with Godot's unique data types and structures.

## Features
- **Versatile Data Handling**: GKDTree is designed to work with Godot's dynamic data types, accepting both `godot::PackedVector2Array` and `godot::PackedVector3Array` through `godot::Variant` and `godot::Array` parameters. This makes it flexible and easy to use within the Godot environment.
- **Nearest Point and Neighborhood Queries**: With methods for finding the nearest point and querying neighborhoods, GKDTree allows for efficient spatial queries, essential for a wide range of applications such as game development, simulation, and real-time applications within Godot.
- **Optimized for Godot-cpp**: Specifically optimized for use with godot-cpp, GKDTree brings the power of KDTree structures to Godot developers working with C++, enabling high-performance spatial queries in your projects.


# KDTree

Simple C++ static KD-Tree implementation with minimal functionality.

- points are given as STL vectors (and inserted in their own STL vector) so supports n-dimensional points for any n
- makes full trees, (i.e. does not cut-off the branching at some arbitrary level) giving the nearest neighbor query have (strong) logarithmic complexity.
- builds the tree in one go (does not support adding nodes, the tree is built from a list of points and cannot be altered afterwards)
- points are assumed to be STL vectors
- it provides the following queries:
	- nearest neighbor
	- neighbors within a given distance
