# GKDTree - A KDTree Extension for Godot Engine

GKDTree is a godot-cpp compatible wrapper for a KDTree implementation as provided by @walaj and @crvs.

## Features
- **Versatile Data Handling**: GKDTree is designed to work with Godot's dynamic data types, accepting `Vector2`, `Vector3`, `Array`, `godot::PackedVector2Array` and `godot::PackedVector3Array` through `godot::Variant` and `godot::Array` parameters. This makes it flexible and easy to use within the Godot environment.
- **Nearest Point and Neighborhood Queries**: With methods for finding the nearest point and querying neighborhoods, GKDTree allows for efficient spatial queries.

## Setup
1. Clone into `<YourProject>/addons`.
2.  navigate into GKDTree directory.
3. For godot-cpp:
```console
git submodule init
git submodule update
```
4. run scons to compile the addon.
```console
scons
```

I don't provide binaries yet. But this should not be harder than to compile godot. In fact, the process is identical.

# KDTree

Simple C++ static KD-Tree implementation with minimal functionality.

- points are given as STL vectors (and inserted in their own STL vector) so supports n-dimensional points for any n
- makes full trees, (i.e. does not cut-off the branching at some arbitrary level) giving the nearest neighbor query have (strong) logarithmic complexity.
- builds the tree in one go (does not support adding nodes, the tree is built from a list of points and cannot be altered afterwards)
- points are assumed to be STL vectors
- it provides the following queries both for vertices and indices:
	- nearest neighbor
	- neighbors within a given distance
